Hi, my name is André and this is my first post here. First and foremost: english is not my mother tongue, so eventually I will commit (maybe I'm commiting right now while writing this text) some grammatical mistakes on my posts, so be kind. Here is a place which I hope to share (in my spare time ~and when I feel like~) some knowledge, mostly about some project I'm working on or some technical stuff which may be of interest of other people. For now, that's it. See you soon (or not).
