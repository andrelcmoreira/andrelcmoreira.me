hi, my name is andr√© and this is my first post here. first and foremost: english is not my mother tongue, so eventually i will commit (maybe i'm commiting right now while i'm writing this) some gramatical mistakes on my posts, so be kind. here is a place which i will try to share ~with unknown frequency~ some knowledge (mostly about technical stuff) which may be of interest of other people. for now, that's it.
