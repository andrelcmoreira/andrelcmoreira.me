Hi, my name is Andr√© and this is my first post here. First and foremost: english is not my mother tongue, so eventually I will commit (maybe I'm commiting right now while writing this text) some grammatical mistakes on my posts, so please be kind. Here is a place which I hope to share (in my spare time ~and when I feel like~) some knowledge, mostly about projects I'm working on or about some technical stuff which may be of interest of other people. For now, that's it and see you soon (or not).
