Hi, my name is André and this is my first post here. First and foremost: english is not my mother tongue so, eventually I will commit (maybe I'm commiting right now while writing this text) some grammatical mistakes on my posts, please be kind. Here is a place which I hope to share (in my spare time) some knowledge, mostly about projects I'm working on or about some stuff which may interest other people. For now, that's it and see you soon (or not).
