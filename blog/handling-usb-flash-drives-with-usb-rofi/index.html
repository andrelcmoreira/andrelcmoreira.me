These environments offer a rich ecosystem of user-facing applications — such as file managers, application launchers, text editors, and terminal emulators — along with system-level applications (which are typically not launched directly by users), like window managers, system monitors, and more. In short, DEs provide a wide range of conveniences for <code>Linux</code> users, especially for those who prefer not to deal with the complexity of the operating system and simply want things to "just work" with minimal effort.<p>However, there's life outside the world of desktop environments.<p>For users who prefer fine-grained control over every installed package and configuration made on their system — like myself — a tiling window manager combined with a few essential applications and configuration files is a good and pretty common choice. In such minimalist environments, one common issue I faced (and I guess it's a pretty common one) was the lack of a mechanism to handle USB events (such as device attachment/removal). To addresss this, <strong>usb-rofi</strong> was born.<h3 id=usb-rofi>usb-rofi</h3><p><a href=https://github.com/andrelcmoreira/usb-rofi>usb-rofi</a> is a simple tool designed to simplify the management of USB flash drives. It leverages the power of the <code>rofi</code> app launcher and <code>udev</code>. Currently at version <code>0.1.1</code>, the tool consists of an <code>udev</code> rule — which triggers the <code>usb-rofi</code> script whenever a new USB device is attached to the system — and the script itself, which prompts the user to choose an action (mount or ignore the device).<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The tool has been tested primarily on Void Linux — my daily driver — and Debian. You're welcome to test it on other distributions and report any issues via email or the GitHub repository.</blockquote><h3 id=setting-things-up>Setting things up</h3><p>After cloning the repository, simply run:<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash style=color:#dedede;background-color:#393939><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span>$ make usb-rofi
