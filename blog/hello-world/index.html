First and foremost: english is not my mother tongue so, eventually I will commit (maybe I'm commiting right now while writing this text) some grammatical mistakes on my posts, please be kind. Here is a place which I hope to share (in my spare time <del>and when I feel like</del>) some knowledge, mostly about projects I'm working on or about some stuff which may interest other people, related to software development, linux, security, IoT or low level in general. For now, that's it and see you soon (or not).<p align=center><img src=/blog/hello-world/thats_all.gif></article></main>
